### Sum ( ∑ )
How many elements are there with property T in the array?

### Decision
Is there an element of T property in the array?
We are unaware if there is an element like that.

### Selection
We are aware that there is an element with T property in the array.
What is the very first element's index?

### Count
We return the amount of elements inside the array with property T.

### Max / Min


### Union ( A∪B )

### Intersection ( A∩B )

### Linear Search
Is there an element of T property in the array?
If there is, what place does it occupies in the array?

### Binary / Logaritmic Search
Input has to be in sorted order.
Is there an element in the array?
What is the very first element's index?
We always try to find a new middle inside the array, that way we can completely ignore one of the sides we are sure the answer isn't in.
